<li>Node.js</li>
<li>npm</li>
<li>lite-server</li>
</ul>

## To set up the server

<p>To start, we will execute `npm init` command. This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file. It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.</p>

<p>We will use lite-server which is a simple customized wrapper around BrowserSync to make it easy to serve SINGLE PAGE APPS (SPAs).
For installation follow the Installation and Usage recommendations given in this link https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server.
After that, the package.json file is modified adding "devDependencies", and download libraries which are saved into node_modules dir.</p>

<p>Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and save it as a dependency in the package.json file.</p>
